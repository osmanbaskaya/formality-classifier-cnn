subjective	the problem isn't that the movie hits so close to home so much as that it hits close to home while engaging in such silliness as that snake-down-the-throat business and the inevitable shot of schwarzenegger outrunning a fireball . 
subjective	nothing more than an amiable but unfocused bagatelle that plays like a loosely-connected string of acting-workshop exercises . 
subjective	the film's sense of imagery gives it a terrible strength , but it's propelled by the acting .

subjective	the title helpfully offers the most succinct review of it you'll read anywhere .

subjective	a great script brought down by lousy direction . same guy with both hats . big mistake . 
subjective	this is , not to put too fine a point on it , a swashbuckler , a costume drama . if you love that old story form , you will be in old-fogy heaven , as it is nearly a perfect example of a genre that died out years ago . 
subjective	like to think of the film as local hero for kids , as the boy has to adapt from his urban kid lifestyle to the slow , simple ways of generations before . will he do it ? will it work out ? can love overcome ?

subjective	though this film can be clumsy , its ambitions are equally -- and admirably -- uncommercial . 
subjective	being author wells' great-grandson , you'd think filmmaker simon wells would have more reverence for the material . but this costly dud is a far cry from either the book or the beloved film . 
subjective	[i]t's certainly laudable that the movie deals with hot-button issues in a comedic context , but barbershop isn't as funny as it should be . 
subjective	deliriously funny , fast and loose , accessible to the uninitiated , and full of surprises
subjective	unlike his directorial efforts , la femme nikita and the professional , the transporter lacks besson's perspective as a storyteller .

subjective	it may not be " last tango in paris " but . . . 
subjective	there's much tongue in cheek in the film and there's no doubt the filmmaker is having fun with it all . 
subjective	care deftly captures the wonder and menace of growing up , but he never really embraces the joy of fuhrman's destructive escapism or the grace-in-rebellion found by his characters .

subjective	a moving and stark reminder that the casualties of war reach much further than we imagine . 
subjective	a psychological thriller that doesn't really hold up if you think about it too much , but is nonetheless highly entertaining in a low-budget , david lynch-ian way . 
subjective	part of the long , noble tradition ( at least since the '90s ) of talky , ensemble-driven american indies . 
subjective	this odd , poetic road movie , spiked by jolts of pop music , pretty much takes place in morton's ever-watchful gaze -- and it's a tribute to the actress , and to her inventive director , that the journey is such a mesmerizing one . 
subjective	as directed by dani kouyate of burkina faso , sia lacks visual flair . but kouyate elicits strong performances from his cast , and he delivers a powerful commentary on how governments lie , no matter who runs them . 
subjective	although melodramatic and predictable , this romantic comedy explores the friendship between five filipino-americans and their frantic efforts to find love .

subjective	slowly but surely devolves into a fascinating , cringe-inducing portrait of cultural solipsism , climaxing in an emotional meltdown that wouldn't look out of place in mid-period cassavetes . 
subjective	a feel-good picture in the best sense of the term . 
subjective	it's lazy for a movie to avoid solving one problem by trying to distract us with the solution to another . 
subjective	scorsese doesn't give us a character worth giving a damn about . 
subjective	it's hard not to like a film that has sky divers jumping out of helicopters to catch flying dragons in a big net . 
subjective	none of this is half as moving as the filmmakers seem to think . 
subjective	what was once original has been co-opted so frequently that it now seems pedestrian . 
subjective	this idea has lost its originality . . . and neither star appears very excited at rehashing what was basically a one-joke picture . 
subjective	to show these characters in the act and give them no feelings of remorse -- and to cut repeatedly to the flashback of the original rape -- is overkill to the highest degree .

subjective	a comedy-drama of nearly epic proportions rooted in a sincere performance by the title character undergoing midlife crisis . 
subjective	it's their familial ups and downs that shift this small , stubbornly poignant documentary . . . from the realm of special-interest audiences to the more universal theater of family psychodynamics .

subjective	even when crush departs from the 4w formula . . . it feels like a glossy rehash . 
subjective	the château would have been benefited from a sharper , cleaner script before it went in front of the camera . not to mention a sharper , cleaner camera lens . 
subjective	novak manages to capture a cruelly hilarious vein of black comedy in the situation with his cast of non-actors and a gritty , no-budget approach . 
subjective	the problem with this film is that it lacks focus . i sympathize with the plight of these families , but the movie doesn't do a very good job conveying the issue at hand . 
subjective	could use a little more humanity , but it never lacks in eye-popping visuals . 
subjective	a reminder that beyond all the hype and recent digital glitz , spielberg knows how to tell us about people . 
subjective	the film is hampered by its predictable plot and paper-thin supporting characters . 
subjective	if your senses haven't been dulled by slasher films and gorefests , if you're a connoisseur of psychological horror , this is your ticket .

subjective	'you'll laugh for not quite and hour and a half , but come out feeling strangely unsatisfied . you'll feel like you ate a reeses without the peanut butter . . . '

subjective	with we were soldiers , hollywood makes a valiant attempt to tell a story about the vietnam war before the pathology set in . 
subjective	like a fish that's lived too long , austin powers in goldmember has some unnecessary parts and is kinda wrong in places . 
subjective	the sequel drops the adult aspects of the story in favor of talking reindeer and a life-size , plastic santa replacement ( also played by allen ) that is strongly reminiscent of that creepy family from the duracell commercials . 
subjective	an unremarkable , modern action/comedy buddy movie whose only nod to nostalgia is in the title . 
subjective	a romantic comedy enriched by a sharp eye for manners and mores . 
subjective	what emerges is not only an underdog v . simon bar sinister saga but a fascinating character study .

subjective	the crime matters less than the characters , although the filmmakers supply enough complications , close calls and double-crosses to satisfy us . 
subjective	swimming isn't a major film . nor does it try to be . but what , in the end , is a major film ? if it's one that accomplishes what it sets out to do , then we ought to correct ourselves . 
subjective	obstacles are too easily overcome and there isn't much in the way of character development in the script . 
subjective	on the right track to something that's creepy and effective . . . it's just going to take more than a man in a bullwinkle costume to get there . 
subjective	embarrassed myself about laughing out loud multiple times , i found myself enjoying the movie much more than i ever enjoyed the tv show . . . and these pseudo-homo-erotic stunts . 
subjective	aimed squarely at the least demanding of demographic groups : very small children who will be delighted simply to spend more time with familiar cartoon characters .

subjective	despite its faults , this is a fascinating look at a subculture . 
subjective	less worrying about covering all the drama in frida's life and more time spent exploring her process of turning pain into art would have made this a superior movie .

subjective	an inexperienced director , mehta has much to learn . 
subjective	sounding like arnold schwarzenegger , with a physique to match , [ahola] has a wooden delivery and encounters a substantial arc of change that doesn't produce any real transformation . 
subjective	mib ii is a movie that makes it possible for the viewer to doze off for a few minutes or make several runs to the concession stand and/or restroom and not feel as if he or she has missed anything . that's because relatively nothing happens . 
subjective	shadyac , who belongs with the damned for perpetrating patch adams , trots out every ghost trick from the sixth sense to the mothman prophecies . 
subjective	huppert's superbly controlled display of murderous vulnerability ensures that malice has a very human face . 
subjective	makes an aborbing if arguable case for the man's greatness . 
subjective	as an entertainment , the movie keeps you diverted and best of all , it lightens your wallet without leaving a sting . 
subjective	most of the information has already appeared in one forum or another and , no matter how broomfield dresses it up , it tends to speculation , conspiracy theories or , at best , circumstantial evidence . 
subjective	so muddled , repetitive and ragged that it says far less about the horrifying historical reality than about the filmmaker's characteristic style . 
subjective	any film that doesn't even in passing mention political prisoners , poverty and the boat loads of people who try to escape the country is less a documentary and more propaganda by way of a valentine sealed with a kiss . 
subjective	a tender , witty , captivating film about friendship , love , memory , trust and loyalty . 
subjective	professionally speaking , it's tempting to jump ship in january to avoid ridiculous schlock like this shoddy suspense thriller . 
subjective	a pointed , often tender , examination of the pros and cons of unconditional love and familial duties . 
subjective	ben affleck as jack ryan , tom clancy's intrepid hero ? ridiculous . what's next ? d . j . qualls as indiana jones ? or tom green as han solo ? 
subjective	i basically went in expecting garbage , but color me surprised when it actually turned out to be quite funny ! 
subjective	the film tunes into a grief that could lead a man across centuries . 
subjective	turning a great movie into a pretty good one is still a step in the wrong direction . . . and the ring will never be more than a pretty good movie . 
subjective	formula 51 is pretty much quentin tarantino meets guy ritchie , as directed by ronny yu . however , if you like that sort of thing , as i do , you just might have some fun with the chemical imbalance of formula 51 . 
subjective	at once emotional and richly analytical , the cosby-seinfeld encounter alone confirms the serious weight behind this superficially loose , larky documentary . 
subjective	the sweetest thing is expressly for idiots who don't care what kind of sewage they shovel into their mental gullets to simulate sustenance . 
subjective	i'm not sure which will take longer to heal : the welt on johnny knoxville's stomach from a riot-control projectile or my own tortured psyche . 
subjective	the advantage of a postapocalyptic setting is that it can be made on the cheap . any rock pile will do for a set . reign of fire has the disadvantage of also looking cheap . 
subjective	an engaging documentary about people who live in unusual homes . 
subjective	kung pow is oedekerk's realization of his childhood dream to be in a martial-arts flick , and proves that sometimes the dreams of youth should remain just that . 
subjective	a film without surprise geared toward maximum comfort and familiarity . 
subjective	sorvino makes the princess seem smug and cartoonish , and the film only really comes alive when poor hermocrates and leontine pathetically compare notes about their budding amours .

subjective	outrageousness is all plympton seemed to be going for this time . we miss the quirky amazement that used to come along for an integral part of the ride .

subjective	swims in mediocrity , sticking its head up for a breath of fresh air now and then . 
subjective	if you're part of her targeted audience , you'll cheer . otherwise , maybe . 
subjective	julia is played with exasperating blandness by laura regan . 
subjective	the problem with all of this : it's not really funny .

subjective	viewing this underdramatized but overstated film is like watching a transcript of a therapy session brought to humdrum life by some freudian puppet . 
subjective	as an actor's showcase , hart's war has much to recommend it , even if the top-billed willis is not the most impressive player . as a story of dramatic enlightenment , the screenplay by billy ray and terry george leaves something to be desired . 
subjective	there's plenty to enjoy -- in no small part thanks to lau . 
subjective	charly comes off as emotionally manipulative and sadly imitative of innumerable past love story derisions . 
subjective	it's incredible the number of stories the holocaust has generated . just when you think that every possible angle has been exhausted by documentarians , another new film emerges with yet another remarkable yet shockingly little-known perspective . 
subjective	for all its impressive craftsmanship , and despite an overbearing series of third-act crescendos , lily chou-chou never really builds up a head of emotional steam . 
subjective	unlike most anime , whose most ardent fans outside japan seem to be introverted young men with fantasy fetishes , metropolis never seems hopelessly juvenile . 
subjective	this is cruel , misanthropic stuff with only weak claims to surrealism and black comedy . 
subjective	trailer park magnolia : too long , too cutesy , too sure of its own importance , and possessed of that peculiar tension of being too dense & about nothing at all . 
subjective	thoughtless , random , superficial humour and a lot of very bad scouse accents

subjective	what better message than 'love thyself' could young women of any size receive ? 
subjective	the exposition does pay off , if you can stay awake that long . there's little gripping in the film until the second hour . 
subjective	lan yu seems altogether too slight to be called any kind of masterpiece . it is , however , a completely honest , open-hearted film that should appeal to anyone willing to succumb to it . 
subjective	in his role of observer of the scene , lawrence sounds whiny and defensive , as if his life-altering experiences made him bitter and less mature . 
subjective	a psychologically rich and suspenseful moral thriller with a stellar performance by al pacino . 
subjective	philip k . dick must be turning in his grave , along with my stomach . 
subjective	sillier , cuter , and shorter than the first ( as best i remember ) , but still a very good time at the cinema . 
subjective	hoffman spends a good deal of screen time alone and without much dialogue , using only his considerable physical skill and screen presence to pull off the role . 
subjective	macbeth . mcdonald's . how far apart these poles of popular culture seemed until billy morrissette's sly mcshakespeare crime comedy . 
subjective	bielinsky's script is slick and fiendishly clever , with seemingly a twist a minute . 
subjective	sadly , 'garth' hasn't progressed as nicely as 'wayne . '
subjective	in the pianist , polanski is saying what he has long wanted to say , confronting the roots of his own preoccupations and obsessions , and he allows nothing to get in the way . 
subjective	romanek keeps adding flourishes -- artsy fantasy sequences -- that simply feel wrong . they cheapen the overall effect .

subjective	the april 2002 instalment of the american war for independence , complete with loads of cgi and bushels of violence , but not a drop of human blood . 
subjective	first , for a movie that tries to be smart , it's kinda dumb . and second , what's with all the shooting ? 
subjective	drumline is a movie that treats its characters and audience with respect ; it can't be accused of being a dumbed-down teen comedy . 
subjective	whenever it threatens to get bogged down in earnest dramaturgy , a stirring visual sequence like a surge through swirling rapids or a leap from pinnacle to pinnacle rouses us . if horses could fly , this is surely what they'd look like . 
subjective	if you're willing to have fun with it , you won't feel cheated by the high infidelity of unfaithful . 
subjective	not only a reminder of how they used to make movies , but also how they sometimes still can be made .

subjective	[a] wonderfully loopy tale of love , longing , and voting . 
subjective	cannon's confidence and laid-back good spirits are , with the drumming routines , among the film's saving graces . 
subjective	winds up being both revelatory and narcissistic , achieving some honest insight into relationships that most high-concept films candy-coat with pat storylines , precious circumstances and beautiful stars . 
subjective	culkin turns his character into what is basically an anti-harry potter -- right down to the gryffindor scarf . 
subjective	it's not a film to be taken literally on any level , but its focus always appears questionable . 
subjective	i suspect this is the kind of production that would have been funnier if the director had released the outtakes theatrically and used the film as a bonus feature on the dvd .

subjective	unambitious writing emerges in the movie , using a plot that could have come from an animated-movie screenwriting textbook . 
subjective	beautifully shot against the frozen winter landscapes of grenoble and geneva , the film unfolds with all the mounting tension of an expert thriller , until the tragedy beneath it all gradually reveals itself . 
subjective	it just goes to show , an intelligent person isn't necessarily an admirable storyteller .

subjective	the character of zigzag is not sufficiently developed to support a film constructed around him . 
subjective	the movie is virtually without context -- journalistic or historical . what's worse is that pelosi knows it . 
subjective	there's no denying the physically spectacular qualities of the film . . . or the emotional integrity of the performances . 
subjective	with youthful high spirits , tautou remains captivating throughout michele's religious and romantic quests , and she is backed by a likable cast . 
subjective	despite the surface attractions -- conrad l . hall's cinematography will likely be nominated for an oscar next year -- there's something impressive and yet lacking about everything . 
subjective	it's a drawling , slobbering , lovable run-on sentence of a film , a southern gothic with the emotional arc of its raw blues soundtrack .

subjective	a movie that hovers somewhere between an acute character study and a trite power struggle . 
subjective	gangs , despite the gravity of its subject matter , is often as fun to watch as a good spaghetti western . 
subjective	in other words , it's just another sports drama/character study . yet this one makes up for in heart what it lacks in outright newness . plus , like i already mentioned . . . it's robert duvall ! c'mon ! 
subjective	woo has as much right to make a huge action sequence as any director , but how long will filmmakers copy the " saving private ryan " battle scenes before realizing steven spielberg got it right the first time ? 
subjective	the script isn't very good ; not even someone as gifted as hoffman ( the actor ) can make it work . 
subjective	in scope , ambition and accomplishment , children of the century . . . takes kurys' career to a whole new level . 
subjective	 . . . too slow , too boring , and occasionally annoying . 
subjective	beautifully acted , smart and funny . it steers clear of being a maudlin soap opera normally found on lifetime . 
subjective	in comparison to his earlier films it seems a disappointingly thin slice of lower-class london life ; despite the title . . . amounts to surprisingly little . 
subjective	a bit of whimsically warped history elevated by the central performance of ian holm .

subjective	a terrific insider look at the star-making machinery of tinseltown . 
subjective	it's a celebration of self-confidence and a slap in the face of a society that cherises impossibly unnatural physical perfection . 
subjective	the sweetest thing , a romantic comedy with outrageous tendencies , may be a mess in a lot of ways . but it does have one saving grace . a lot of its gags and observations reflect a woman's point-of-view . 
subjective	instead of a hyperbolic beat-charged urban western , it's an unpretentious , sociologically pointed slice of life . 
subjective	an absurdist comedy about alienation , separation and loss . 
subjective	a stunning and overwhelmingly cogent case for kissinger as a calculating war criminal . 
subjective	the only camouflage carvey should now be considering is a paper bag to wear over his head when he goes out into public , to avoid being recognized as the man who bilked unsuspecting moviegoers . 
subjective	a film that begins with the everyday lives of naval personnel in san diego and ends with scenes so true and heartbreaking that tears welled up in my eyes both times i saw the film . 
subjective	malone does have a gift for generating nightmarish images that will be hard to burn out of your brain . but the movie's narrative hook is way too muddled to be an effectively chilling guilty pleasure . 
subjective	one regards reign of fire with awe . what a vast enterprise has been marshaled in the service of such a minute idea .

subjective	little is done to support the premise other than fling gags at it to see which ones shtick . 
subjective	soderbergh seems capable only of delivering artfully lighted , earnest inquiries that lack the kind of genuine depth that would make them redeemable .

subjective	absorbing and disturbing -- perhaps more disturbing than originally intended -- but a little clarity would have gone a long way . 
subjective	sunshine state is sayles at his most robert altman-ish , purposefully juggling about a dozen narrative balls in the air , and letting the mundanity and smallish drama of everyday life tell a larger story .

subjective	this is snappy , frothy screwball comedy awash in french understatement . 
subjective	seeing as the film lacks momentum and its position remains mostly undeterminable , the director's experiment is a successful one . 
subjective	i'm sure if you're a hartley fan , you might enjoy yourself . . . me , i didn't care for it . 
subjective	beautifully written and directed and packed with excellent performances . 
subjective	whether seen on a 10-inch television screen or at your local multiplex , the edge-of-your-seat , educational antics of steve irwin are priceless entertainment . 
subjective	this may not be great moviemaking . . . but it's vastly enjoyable in a low-down , scandal-mongering way . 
subjective	this is almodovar's stab at serious drama , and the result is bizarre and affecting but also unsettling in ways that the filmmaker may not have intended .

subjective	director robert rodriguez has once again caught lightning in a bottle . 
subjective	try as you might to resist , if you've got a place in your heart for smokey robinson , this movie will worm its way there . 
subjective	there's something fishy about a seasonal holiday kids' movie . . . that derives its moment of most convincing emotional gravity from a scene where santa gives gifts to grownups .

subjective	the film's final hour , where nearly all the previous unseen material resides , is unconvincing soap opera that tornatore was right to cut .

subjective	a baffling subplot involving smuggling drugs inside danish cows falls flat , and if you're going to alter the bard's ending , you'd better have a good alternative . 
subjective	broomfield reveals an ironic manifestation of institutionalized slavery that ties a black-owned record label with a white-empowered police force . 
subjective	on balance , i recommend the movie both for nicholson's performance and for the opportunity to spend some time with the kind of man that we often meet in real life , but rarely see on screen . 
subjective	if you keep a list of films you want to see one way or another , you would be doing yourself a service by keeping this film high up on that list . 
subjective	it doesn't do a lot of deep thinking , but unlike many futuristic combos of sf and f/x , it does make a statement : freedom of opinion is a threat to totalitarian systems . 
subjective	like edward norton in american history x , ryan gosling ( murder by numbers ) delivers a magnetic performance .

subjective	the soundtrack alone -- the literal pulse of the thing -- will rock you in your seat . 
subjective	the production values are up there . the use of cgi and digital ink-and-paint make the thing look really slick . the voices are fine as well . the problem , it is with most of these things , is the script . 
subjective	while the film really doesn't have anything new to say , it's still thoughtful and well-crafted . 
subjective	moore's complex and important film is also , believe it or not , immensely entertaining , a david and goliath story that's still very much playing itself out .

subjective	ram dass fierce grace moulds itself as an example to up-and-coming documentarians , of the overlooked pitfalls of such an endeavour . 
subjective	it has the air of a surprisingly juvenile lark , a pop-influenced prank whose charms are immediately apparent and wear thin with repetition .

subjective	it's not an important picture , and probably not even a memorable one , but i had a good time . 
subjective	i stopped thinking about how good it all was , and started doing nothing but reacting to it - feeling a part of its grand locations , thinking urgently as the protagonists struggled , feeling at the mercy of its inventiveness , gasping at its visual delights . 
subjective	a naturally funny film , home movie makes you crave chris smith's next movie . 
subjective	it is as uncompromising as it is nonjudgmental , and makes clear that a prostitute can be as lonely and needy as any of the clients .

subjective	wilco fans will have a great time , and the movie should win the band a few new converts , too . 
subjective	for each chuckle there are at least 10 complete misses , many coming from the amazingly lifelike tara reid , whose acting skills are comparable to a cardboard cutout .

subjective	opens at a funeral , ends on the protagonist's death bed and doesn't get much livelier in the three hours in between . 
subjective	' . . . the film's considered approach to its subject matter is too calm and thoughtful for agitprop , and the thinness of its characterizations makes it a failure as straight drama . '

subjective	admirers of director abel ferrara may be relieved that his latest feature , r xmas , marks a modest if encouraging return to form . 
subjective	there's a bit of thematic meat on the bones of queen of the damned , as its origins in an anne rice novel dictate , but generally , it's a movie that emphasizes style over character and substance .
